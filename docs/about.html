	    <h3>Some History</h3>
    
        <p>SiteMesh was originally written about 5 years ago, after Joe Walnes 
        downloaded the first sun servlet engine and wrote it using servlet 
        chains (before filters).</p>
    
        <p>He had been using it internally for about 2 years and by the time it 
        was opensourced it was quite mature. Over the years, the basic design 
        remained the same; content was intercepted, parsed, a decorator mapper 
        was used to find a decorator and they were merged together.</p>
        
        <p>There were 2 main leaps that helped make it succesful - the rewrite 
        from servlet-chain to servlet-filter when the first draft of the Servlet 
        2.3 API came out about 3 years ago and Victor Salaman rewriting the 
        parser to make it about 12 times faster.</p>
